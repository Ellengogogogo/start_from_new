# Cursor Rules for Immobilien Expos√© Generator Project

## General Guidelines
- Always implement features using the simplest possible solution that still follows modern best practices, without adding any unnecessary code, dependencies, or scripts.
- If you want to run some command in the backend folder, always run .\.venv\Scripts\activate firstly to activate the virtual environment.
- You should make a plan for the problem firstly, after that execute.
- If you encounter any problems during execution, record the lessons learned back into the .cursorrules file.

## Lessons Learned

### Translation and Localization
- When translating large form files from Chinese to German, it's more efficient to:
  1. First update the steps array and main navigation elements
  2. Then translate each form step section individually
  3. Use search_replace for specific sections rather than trying to replace entire large blocks
  4. Focus on user-facing text first (labels, placeholders, options) before internal logic
  5. Maintain consistent German terminology throughout (e.g., "Immobilie" for property, "Wohnung" for apartment)

### Professional Real-Estate Design Implementation
- Professional real-estate design should include:
  1. Clean, modern typography with proper hierarchy
  2. Professional color schemes (blues, grays, whites)
  3. Better spacing and padding for readability
  4. Gradient backgrounds and modern shadows
  5. Hover effects and smooth transitions
  6. Real-estate specific icons and visual elements
  7. Consistent rounded corners and modern button styles
  8. Professional form layouts with clear visual separation

### Form Translation Strategy
- For multi-step forms, translate in this order:
  1. Step titles and descriptions in the steps array
  2. Page headers and progress indicators
  3. Form field labels and placeholders
  4. Select options and validation messages
  5. Button text and navigation elements
  6. Error messages and help text

### Code Organization
- When dealing with large form files (1000+ lines), break down translations into logical sections
- Use grep_search to find specific text patterns before attempting replacements
- Consider creating a translation mapping file for consistency
- Test each translated section individually to avoid breaking the form functionality
